# Getting from Machine Learning Outputs to Decisions
## Robert Dodier
## ML4ALL 2018

---
# Introduction

---
# Elements of a decision problem

---
# Examples of decision problems

---
# What is a decision theory?

---
# Expected-utility decision theory

---
# Putting expected utility into action

---
# Typical expected utility calculation

```python
>>> p = (0.6, 0.4)    # Probability distribution over states
>>> u = ((50, -100),  # Utility for each (action, state) pair
...      (25, -40),
...      (65, -90))
>>> # Expected utility calculation
... eu = [sum(p1*u1 for p1,u1 in zip(p,uu)) for uu in u]
>>> # Find action which has greatest expected utility
... eu.index(max(eu))
2
```

# Typical expected utility calculation

```python
>>> p = (0.6, 0.4)
>>> u = ((50, -100),
...      (25, -40),
...      (65, -90))
```
--
```python
>>> 0.6*50 + 0.4*(-100)
-10.0
```
--
```python
>>> 0.6*25 + 0.4*(-40)
-1.0
```

```python
>>> 0.6*65 + 0.4*(-90)
3.0
```

# More general decision problems
--
 * What if there are more actions to consider?
--
  * Additional rows in utility matrix `u`
--
 * What if there are more than two discrete states?
--
  * Additional columns in `u` and additional elements in probability tuple `p`
--
 * What if states are continuous instead of discrete?
--
  * Expected utility calculation is an integral instead of a summation
  * Need to represent probability distribution as continuous function
--
 * What if actions are continuous instead of discrete?
--
  * Need to maximize expected utility over continuous variable
