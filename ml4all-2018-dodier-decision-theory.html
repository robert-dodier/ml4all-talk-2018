# Introduction

 * Your ML delivers tons and tons of predictions and estimates!

 * What to do with all those numbers?

---
# Examples of decision problems

 * Given history of purchases, what ads to show?

--

 * Given personal data and service history, what rebate or offer to give to someone to make them stay on service?

--

 * Given demographic data and test data, do we need to order another medical test?

--

 * Given history and geology, how should we prepare for next earthquake?

---
# Elements of a decision problem

 * Decision = select from alternative actions

--

 * ... on the basis of beliefs and preferences

--

 * Separation of beliefs and preferences greatly simplifies the problem

--

  * Beliefs = what we infer from facts

  * Preferences = what we like, expressed as values, payoffs, or costs and benefits

---
# Elements of a decision problem

 * In a ML context, beliefs are typically calculated by the ML model

--

 * Preferences can often be handled as a post-processing step

  * Handling preferences often much simpler computationally than beliefs!

---
# Elements of a decision problem

 * Preferences often express important business logic

  * Evaluate outcome of decision from point of view of business requirements

--

 * In addition, constraints on possible actions also express business logic
 
  * Set of possible actions determined from business requirements

---
# What is a decision theory?

--
 * A decision theory is a way to derive "best" actions from other considerations

  * We'll derive actions from beliefs and preferences

--
 * We'll look at a normative theory -- i.e., what's the right way to go about it

  * Descriptive theory is different -- humans only approximately rational

---
# Expected-utility decision theory

--
 * Rational choice = choose action to have greatest expected utility

  * Expected = averaged over possible outcomes, weighted by belief

--
 * Paraphrase: lottery ticket value is equal to its expected payoff

  * Among tickets available, choose the one with greatest expected payoff

---
# Expected-utility decision theory

 * Expected utility = `\(\sum_i p_i u_{j,i}\)` for each action `\(j\)`
 
 * ... where `\(p_i\)` are probabilities over states `\(i\)`

 * ... and `\(u_{j,i}\)` is utility of action `\(j\)` in state `\(i\)`

---
# Putting expected utility into action

--
 * Need to identify the states over which beliefs are assessed

  * These states will be the outputs of our ML model

--
 * Need to identify the set of possible actions

  * Incorporate business constraints

--
 * Need to assess preferences for each (action, state) pair

  * One can express preferences as costs, but I find it easier to think about benefits

---
# Commonly-used ML models which output probabilities

--
 * Logistic regression

--
 * Neural network with logistic output

--
 * Neural network with softmax output

--
 * Naive Bayes

--
 * Tree-structured models

--
 * ... and many others

---
# Models from which probabilities can be derived

--
 * Any regression model with additive noise

  * Model output gives conditional mean

  * Noise model gives conditional distribution around mean

--
 * Linear regression

 * Neural network regression

---
# Non-probabilistic outputs: SVM

 * Theoretical formulation SVM is essentially jumping to final decision

 * ... going directly from input to a class determination without intervening steps

 * People have tried to retrofit SVM with probability of class

 * If probabilities are needed, my advice is to use some other model

---
# Not-exactly-probabilistic outputs: R randomForest

 * randomForest in R is a popular tree-structured classifier

 * A large number of trees are generated from randomized inputs

 * "Probability" outputs computed from voting among trees

 * This isn't quite right; should assess probabilities by counting data, not models

 * Should be straightforward to fix up output to get probabilities

# Typical expected utility calculation

```python
>>> p = (0.6, 0.4)    # Probability distribution over states
```
--
```python
>>> u = ((50, -100),  # Utility for each (action, state) pair
...      (25, -40),
...      (65, -90))
```

---
# Typical expected utility calculation

```python
>>> p = (0.6, 0.4)    # Probability distribution over states
>>> u = ((50, -100),  # Utility for each (action, state) pair
...      (25, -40),
...      (65, -90))
```

 * Need to calculate `\(\sum_i p_i u_{j,i}\)` for each action `\(j\)` and find maximum element
 
 * That's `\(p_0 u_{0,0} + p_1 u_{0,1}\)`, `\(p_0 u_{1,0} + p_1 u_{1,1}\)`, `\(p_0 u_{2,0} + p_1 u_{2,1}\)` in this problem

```
```python
>>> # Expected utility calculation
... eu = [sum(p1*u1 for p1,u1 in zip(p,uu)) for uu in u]
```
```python
>>> # Find action which has greatest expected utility
... eu.index(max(eu))
2

# More general decision problems

--
 * What if there are more actions to consider?

--
  * Additional rows in utility matrix `u`

--
 * What if there are more than two discrete states?

--
  * Additional columns in `u` and additional elements in probability tuple `p`

--
 * What if states are continuous instead of discrete?

--
  * Expected utility calculation is an integral instead of a summation

--
 * What if actions are continuous instead of discrete?

--
  * Need to maximize expected utility over continuous variable

---
# Summary: Getting from ML outputs to decisions

 * Separate belief and preference in analysis of decision problem

  * Beliefs = outputs from ML models

  * Preferences = utility function

--
 * Expected-utility decision theory: rank actions by expected utility, pick one that floats to top

  * This expected utility calculation often a simpler postprocessing step

--
 * Preferences and constraints express important business requirements

---
# Points of departure

 * Try to separate beliefs from preferences in your business problem

  * Bring business requirements into the picture via preferences

  * ... and via constraints on actions

 * Be prepared to iterate on preferences and constraints

  * These are often among the most malleable elements of the problem

  * Assessments of preferences often evolve as more is learned about the business

---
# Points of departure

  * Formal statement of preferences is a great way to get input from stakeholders

   * ... while insulating ML pipeline from changes

--
  * But! Expected utility is the tail that wags the dog

   * Output of ML pipeline is determined by requirements of decision analysis
